# hello-world
Basic Repository testing Git features as well as integration with GitKraken.  Primarily used on Fedora 29, looking to develop Android, Web Dev, Windows, and Linux tools/APIs.

A little bit about myself. I like people and enjoy travel.  I really enjoy a proper Manhattan made with orange bitters rather than angostura.  Sunshine is pretty cool.

My best manhattan recipe.

2oz of Rye whisky, the smokier and pepperier the better.
1oz of sweet vermouth, boissaire makes a good one, avoid cinzano.
.25oz of filtered water.
5 dashes of Angostura Orange Bitters

Combine all ingredients in a mixing glass (or pint glass if you don't have a crystal mixing glass) with enough ice to match the liquid.

Take a spoon or the handle of a spoon and gently stir the ingredients in a circle.  Keep touching the outside of your mixing glass until you feel you have successfully rendered the ingredients to the appropriate drinking temp.

Strain your manhattan either up (into a martini or coupe glass) or over ice in a Rocks/Highball/Old Fashioned glass.

Garnish with luxardo/maraschino cherry.

Bottoms up!
