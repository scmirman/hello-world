# hello-world
Basic Repository testing Git features as well as integration with GitKraken.  Primarily used on Fedora 29, looking to develop Android, Web Dev, Windows, and Linux tools/APIs.

A little bit about myself. I like people and enjoy travel.  I really enjoy a proper Manhattan made with orange bitters rather than angostura.  Sunshine is pretty cool.

# My best manhattan recipe.

2oz of Rye whisky, the smokier and pepperier the better.
1oz of sweet vermouth, boissaire makes a good one, avoid cinzano.
.25oz of filtered water.
5 dashes of Angostura Orange Bitters

Combine all ingredients in a mixing glass (or pint glass if you don't have a crystal mixing glass) with enough ice to match the liquid.

Take a spoon or the handle of a spoon and gently stir the ingredients in a circle.  Keep touching the outside of your mixing glass until you feel you have successfully rendered the ingredients to the appropriate drinking temp.

Strain your manhattan either up (into a martini or coupe glass) or over ice in a Rocks/Highball/Old Fashioned glass.

Garnish with luxardo/maraschino cherry.

# Bottoms up!
